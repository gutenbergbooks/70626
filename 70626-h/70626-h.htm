<h2 class="nobreak" id="Introduction"><i>Introduction</i></h2>
</div>

<p>This will introduce to our readers, the
author, Clarkson P. Bearse, Sr. He is a native
Cape Codder and lives in a peaceful typical
Cape Cod home in Harwich Port. In fact he
is Postmaster of the Harwich Port Post office.
He was a former member of the Coast
Guard Station which figured in the Monomoy
disaster. Due to an injury received in the
line of duty he was unable to report for service,
or otherwise he would have been another victim
rather than the author of this thrilling story
of the sea.</p>

<p>For many years he retained the facts about
this world famous tragedy, second only in
importance to the Portland disaster. His modesty
caused him to refrain from telling the
story until his friends finally prevailed upon
him to fill in at a Grange lecture hour one
night. Then Kiwanis listened to him and was
thrilled. Then other organizations sought his
thrilling story. We know he will thrill you,
too, as he paints his vivid word picture.</p>

<p>No living person can tell this story like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Mr. Bearse. This tragedy of the sea is only
one of hundreds of ship wrecks which have
made these shoals known as “The Graveyard
of the Atlantic” all over the world. We are
proud to present this copyrighted edition for
your reading pleasure.</p>

THE TRAGEDY of MONOMOY BEACH<br>

THE GRAVEYARD of THE ATLANTIC<br>
</h3>
<hr class="tb">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p>I was born and brought up on Cape Cod.
To me it is the only place on earth. In
olden times, in times gone by, people
away from here had the idea that Cape Cod
was a narrow strip of land extending off into
the ocean, consisting of sand dunes and fish
shanties. But in recent years there has been
a radical change in the opinion people have
had about Cape Cod. Now they are looking at
Cape Cod as it really is. The automobile, the
chamber of commerce, boards of trade, and
other advertising agencies have opened Cape
Cod wide, and it has been explored from
one end to the other by thousands and thousands.
Now some of these people are prophesying
the future of Cape Cod, but they are not
only prophesying the future of Cape Cod but
they are delving down into the past—down
into its past records and past history. Recently,
almost within the year, they have gone down
forty-one years and have come up with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
old Monomoy Disaster. Sometimes they come
into the post-office and question me about
the disaster. I not only have to admit that I
had been associated with those men who were
lost, but was familiar with the disaster itself,
so I have been telling them and all others
who were interested by an address. I appreciate
the privilege of addressing so many distinguished
gatherings.</p>

<p>It was the seventeenth day of March
1902, when the news spread—and it spread
like wildfire all over—not only over the
towns of Chatham and Harwich, the two towns
most directly affected by the disaster, but over
the surrounding towns and all over Cape Cod,
for that matter. Women ran from one house
to the other, telling the news—men congregated
on corners, in stores and elsewhere,
discussing the news. The report was that
every surfman on the old Monomoy Lifesaving
Station, with the exception of one, had
been lost. They had perished off the back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
side of Monomoy Beach in the tide rips and
the seas. In telling the story, I have entitled
it, “The Tragedy of Monomoy Beach or the
Graveyard of the Atlantic.”</p>

<p>Eight miles down from Harwich is the
town of Chatham. Everybody knows that
Monomoy Beach extends off from Chatham—off
into Nantucket Sound in a southerly
direction something like ten miles. It is approximately
two miles wide, and is composed
wholly of beach sand, a growth of beach
grass, occasionally a brush swamp, and a few
meadows. Its topographic makeup is sand
dunes and hollows, hollows and sand dunes,
all sizes and shapes, and the sand continues
to blow and shift. Today there is a sand
dune, tonight a dry gale of wind, tomorrow a
piece of level ground. Today there is a piece
of level ground, tonight a sand storm, tomorrow
a hollow. So it is, year in and year out.
The sand continues to blow and shift.</p>

<p>Monomoy Beach is bounded on the east by
the broad Atlantic, and the seas—the seas—the
seas roll in from an expanse of three
thousand miles and break and pound and
roar upon the strand in an unbroken line.
Sometimes I tell my friends if they desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
see the ocean in its raw, if they desire to see
those seas that roll in from this tremendous
expanse and break and pound and roar upon
the strand, if they desire to see the tide rips
that break and boil and foam, if they desire
to see the lightships off in the distance guiding
the shipping down over the shoals, if they
desire to see the tide as it sweeps out of
Caleb’s Bay and meets the ocean, and produces
those tremendous tide rips down there
on the end of Monomoy Beach or Point Rip—if
they desire to see all this, I suggest that
someday in an easterly gale they take a trip
down on Monomoy Beach—way down to Point
Rip, and there they will see the ocean in its
raw. Then, in good weather, look off and see
the shoals—the shoals that extend way across
to Nantucket cut down through here and there
by false and major channels, and the tide rips,
hundreds of them breaking and boiling
and foaming—the same shoals and the same
tide rips that turned the Mayflower back three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
hundred and twenty-one years ago. They are
there today.</p>

<p>In the days gone by, in the olden times, the
back side of Monomoy Beach was rightly called
the “Graveyard of the Atlantic.” Why?
Because more ships and more schooners
grounded and pounded themselves to pieces
and washed upon the beach—more men lost
their lives and their bodies strewn along the
back side of Monomoy Beach than any other
like locality in all the world. Why, fifty,
seventy-five, and a hundred years ago did our
fathers brand the back side of Monomoy
Beach the “Graveyard of the Atlantic?” Because
of episodes like this that follow.
This is but one episode, all others were similar.</p>

</div>

<p>Now come with me, if you will, to a country
home somewhere, some place, in
some land. Standing in the open doorway
of that home is a mother and her son, the
son a splendid specimen of physical manhood
standing beside his mother his hand resting
on a sailor’s clothes bag. That morning the
mother had packed that clothes bag until it
was full with warm stockings, warm mittens,
warm underclothes, warm shirts, warm blankets,
and everything a young sailor required.
She was saying to her boy, “Now, Jimmy, you
are going away to sea. You are going to stand
on your own and I want you to be a good boy.
As your mother, I’m concerned over your welfare.
Your success is my life, your joys are
my joys, and your sorrows are my sorrows.
As your mother, I want to know where you
are and how you are getting along. So I
want you to promise me above all other things
that you will write me from every port. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
you’re going out to face the world and experience
life itself, and whatever happens I
want you to be a man. Keep away from the
saloons and the bar-rooms, and leave the booze
alone. Remember the fate of your father—Booze,
the damnable stuff called booze. From
the time it issues from the poisonous coils
of the distillery until it empties into a sea
of crime, degradation, despair and death, it
pollutes every substance and, in a measure,
weakens every man, woman, and child who
comes in contact with it. As your mother,
I am asking you to leave it alone.” He answered,
“Yes mother I am going away to sea.
I am going to stand on my own and I promise
you upon my word of honor that I will write
you from every port. Now I’m going out,
as you say, to face the world, and whatever
happens I intend to play the part of a man.
So far as possible I’ll keep away from the
saloons and bar-rooms and leave the booze
alone.” He picked up his clothes bag, threw
it over his shoulder as young men did of yore,
went down the path to the road and down the
road until he came to a bend in the road. He
stopped and looked back. His mother was
still standing in the doorway. She waved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
her boy good-bye. He waved his mother
good-bye, went around the bend in the road
and was gone, and gone forever, leaving his
mother still standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>That was sixty years ago. Sixty years
ago ninety per cent of all the freight that went
north and south, east and west, along the Atlantic
seaboard went by water and ninety
per cent of all the freight that went by water
went under sail. This was the old sailing
days and there was a tremendous fleet of
those freighters or coasters as we called them,
all rigs, sloop rigs, two-masted schooners,
three-masted schooners, four-masted schooners,
brigs and barks. Anyone who knows anything
about the old sailing days knows that it
was almost an impossibility to beat down
over Nantucket Shoals when the wind was to
the east or north as it is so often here on Cape
Cod. They would anchor as far back as Menemsha
Bight, Tarpaulin Cove, Vineyard Haven,
and Woods Hole. They would anchor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
down off Falmouth, down under the breakwater
at Hyannisport, down under the breakwater
at West Dennis, and wherever there
was an anchorage you would see those schooners
tied up, anchored, waiting for fair wind.
At last it would come, the wind would breeze
up from the west. Then they would hoist their
sails and anchors, get under way, and start
out down over the shoals. You would see them
coming—sometimes hundreds of them—with
their white sails showing like clouds
against the blue sky. In those days the only
outlet going down over the shoals to the east
and the north was the Pollock Rip Slew, a
channel between two shoals. Moored at the
entrance of the Pollock Rip Slew was the old
Pollock Rip Lightship, number 47. It was the
duty of the crew of a lightship in those days
to count and log the shipping that went one way
and the other over the shoals. The Old Pollock
Rip Lightship, number 47, had the record of
having counted and logged in her log book
over five hundred sails in twenty-four hours
going and coming down over the shoals. They
would come down over the shoals, pass out
through Pollock Rip Slew, and head up the
back side of the Cape for their destinations.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>So this day, sixty years ago, the wind was
to the westward and schooners were
passing through Pollock Rip Slew all
day. At sunset that night the head of the fleet
was up off the highlands. From the highlands
down to the tip of the end of Monomoy Beach,
they were scattered along. At dark the wind
had died away to a dead calm. At nine o’clock
that night the wind breezed up to the northeast.
At twelve o’clock there was a living
gale of wind with snow sweeping down across
the back side of Cape Cod and Monomoy
Beach. Whatever became of that fleet of
schooners that passed over the shoals that day
nobody knows. How many of them were that
far advanced that they rounded the Cape and
reached their destinations—how many of them
shortened sail and jogged off into the channel
and saved themselves—how many of them
turned back and tried to get down through
Pollock Rip Slew into smoother water—how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
many of them went ashore on the back side
of Cape Cod and Monomoy Beach—how
many of them founded on the spot, nobody
knows. But the next day the back side of
Cape Cod and Monomoy Beach was strewn
with wreckage. Remember, sixty years ago
there were no telephones connecting one station
with another, so the news leaked down
through to the old Monomoy Lifesaving Station,
Captain William F. Tuttle of Harwichport,
either by gunners or by fishermen, that
there had been some terrible wrecks off the
back side of Monomoy Beach and Cape Cod,
and to look out for bodies. So every surfman
who stepped out of the threshold that night
was warned to look out for bodies.</p>

<p>The first watch down to Point Rip from
8 to 12 was a man by the name of Almond
Wixon of Dennisport. He was walking down
the “Bend,” halfway down from the old Monomoy
Lifesaving Station to the old Monomoy
Lighthouse was a bend in the beach they referred
to as “The Bend”, so walking down
the bend that night he saw an object washing
in the surf. A sea would break, run up the
beach, and the object would roll over and
over; the sea would recede and the object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
would roll back. In telling the story, Almond
Wixon admitted that for a minute he had the
jitters, but he waded in, kicked the object, and
it was nothing but a bunch of seaweed rolled
up in the shape of a man, washing in the surf.
He went on five minutes more—ten minutes
more—then he saw another object in the surf.
This time a sea would break, run up the beach,
the object would roll partly over, the sea
would recede, and the object roll back. Wixon
wasn’t concerned this time for he said to himself,
“It’s nothing but another bunch of seaweed.”
So he waded in again and kicked the
object. As he did, he had the sensation of
kicking an old decayed pumpkin. Remember
that in those days they never carried lanterns
so he bent way over and looked, and,
there at his feet was a dead man washing in
the surf. Poor Almond Wixon, standing there
that night at nine o’clock, two miles from
the Station with a dead man washing at his
feet! Thirty-seven years after he perished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
in the sea himself as one of the crew of the
ill-fated Cross Rip Lightship which was torn
from her moorings by drifting ice, floated off
into oblivion and was never heard from again.</p>

<p>Previous to this, a surfman found a body
in the surf and hastened away to the station
for help. When they returned, the body had
floated away and was lost. After that, the orders
were that whenever you found a body in
the surf, before going for help, to haul it up
over the high-water mark. So Almond Wixon
bent over, turned the dead man on his back,
put his hands down under his armpits, raised
up, and as he did, the dead man fell against
his stomach. In that position he walked
backwards—up, up, over the beach, up
over the high-water mark, and laid the body
down. He hastened away to the station and
notified Captain Tuttle. The captain, in return,
called out every surfman and put them
out on the beach to hunt more bodies. At
daylight they had found four. They found
two to the north of the station, and two to the
south. Then the orders were to assemble
those bodies over on the inside, on the bay
side, ready to take them across to the mainland.
The two they found to the north of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
station they took over on an improvised
stretcher. With two men carrying a stretcher,
they went over the sand dunes, down the hollows
and through the sand, ankle deep. The
two they found to the south of the Station
they pushed over in a pushcart, wheels with
wide tires, over the sand dunes, down in the
hollows, and through the sand. At last they
were assembled on the inside.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago there were no automobiles
coming and going down the beach with
semi-flat tires, as there are today. The only
way those men could get across to the mainland
in winter was in dories. So they loaded
the bodies into a thirteen-foot dory, two in
the bow and two in the stern. A surfman
named Bearse took the forward thwart, and
Captain Tuttle himself took the after thwart,
and they started for Harwichport. It was the
intention of Captain Tuttle that morning to
take those bodies across to Harwichport because
he lived there. He intended to deliver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
them to the medical examiner and the undertaker
and then go home and spend a few
hours with his family before starting back.
After they started, the wind breezed up
to the west. The sun rose in the east and
the wind increased from the west until there
was a strong westerly wind. Heading up for
Harwich Port, they could make no headway
so they eased her off a bit to make headway.
In two hours and a half they arrived in Deep
Hole, South Harwich. They landed at the
foot of Deep Hole Road with the bodies.
What a predicament they were in! Sixty years
ago there were no automobiles, no telephones,
no bicycles—only a few men owned horses.
In order to contact the medical examiner and
the undertaker, it was necessary to walk.
Captain Tuttle left the bodies in charge of
surfman Bearse and started for the undertaker,
who at that time was a man named
Levi Long, who lived on Long Road in the
house now occupied by Jeffrey Delorey. From
the undertaker’s, Captain Tuttle walked up
to Harwich Center. At the corner of Main
and Bank Street where the gas tanks of Mr.
Mulcay are now there was the office of the
medical examiner Dr. George N. Munsel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
From there he walked down by schoolhouses,
down Forest Street to Harwichport, down Sea
Street to his home. He was late and had but
a short time to stay. Then he walked back
to South Harwich, down to the foot of Deep
Hole Road. He and surfman Bearse launched
the dory and, in a strong westerly wind, rowing
in the trough of the sea which is the most
difficult course to row in a heavy sea, they went
back to Monomoy Beach. They landed below
the station just before dark. I am telling
you this part of the story to show you the
tremendous energy of those men and I tell
you men and women, too we’ll have to cease
our dissipation, we’ll have to turn our backs
to the sparkling highballs, we’ll have to cease
our late suppers and late hours if we intend
to match the physical energy of those men of
iron.</p>

<p>That very afternoon, not the next day or
the third day, but that very afternoon with
those mothers somewhere, someplace in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
land, still standing in the doorway, still waiting,
still hoping, still longing for those promised
letters that never, never came—that very
afternoon those young fellows were buried
over in South Harwich Cemetery, on the west
side of the Cemetery something like ten feet
in from the west fence. They were buried
in boxes, common pine boxes, no caskets, no
services, nothing but a simple prayer. At the
head of each one of those graves was placed
a marble marker. They are there today, almost
concealed in the grass. They were
placed there to protect, preserve, and perpetuate
the identity of those graves. For over
sixty years the remains of those young fellows,
some mother’s boys, have been resting
there almost in the shadow of the church, unknown
and unnamed, the victims of the back
side of Monomoy Beach, once branded the
“Graveyard of the Atlantic” because of episodes
like this.</p>

<p>Now we’ll go back to 1902. Time had
passed on. William F. Tuttle, captain
of the old Monomoy Lifesaving Station
had passed away, and Marshall N. Eldredge
of South Chatham was now the keeper. In 1902
halfway down from Chatham to Point Rip
stood the old Monomoy Lifesaving Station.
Four miles from the Chatham Station, four
miles from Point Rip, where it stands today
discarded and deserted. There it stands today
amid the sand dunes and the hollows, a grim
reminder of the tragedy of Monomoy Beach. In
1915 the Life Saving Service was absorbed by
the Coast Guard and today if a young fellow
wishes to become a coastguardsman even though
he has never been out over the surf in an open
boat, he sends in an application. Then there
is the physical and mental examination and
if he obtains the required percentage, everything
else favorable, he is accepted. Then
there is a brand new uniform. But in 1902,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the captains of those stations had the privilege
of selecting their own crew, and listen to me,
they picked the very best, men who had been
down to the sea in ships, men who had served
their time on the Grand Banks, on Quero, and
on George’s stormy shoal, men who had been
called out of their bunks in the dead of night,
men who had crawled aloft ratline by ratline
during dark stormy nights and smothered topsails,
men who had weathered the gales of
winter on the Atlantic sea board. With due
respect to the coast guardsmen of today, they
are nice fellows, their duties are altogether
different, they look fine in their new uniforms,
but those men whose only uniform was their
oil cloths and boots, flannel shirts and khaki
pants, those men who had been down to the
sea in ships, those men who had been over
the surf in open boats, as surfmen, were the
very best the world produced. In 1902 the
old Monomoy Lifesaving Station was manned
with that caliber of men. It was the duty of
a lifesaver to patrol the beach, protect property,
and save lives. Their watch started at
sunrise and ended at sunset. From sunset
until eight o’clock was what was called the
“dog watch”. Then the regular watch began.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Two men were called out of their beds, they
dressed, went out down to the surf half-mile
away and separated. One went north and the
other, south. The man who went north went
until he met the surfman from the Chatham
Station. They exchanged checks, told a few
stories, discussed the news of the day, and
then started back. The one who went south
went down to Point Rip four miles away where
there was a little shanty. In that shanty was
a board seat and, hanging on the wall, was a
telephone connected to the station. Nailed to
the side of the wall was a chain and a key.
He punched his time clock with the key that
was nailed to the wall and started back. The
two men met below the station at twelve
o’clock. They went in, called two more men
who dressed, went out down to the surf and
separated. One went north and the other,
south. So the watch continued.</p>

<p>Now the tragedy develops. It was on the
fifteenth day of March, 1902. A tow was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
coming down over the shoals, a tug boat and
two barges. The outer barge was called the
“Wadena”, the inner barge, the “Fitzpatrick”.
Coming down over the shoals in the
fog and mist, the captain misjudged his position
just a little and was too far in. The
tide running in swept the barges onto Shovelful
Shoal and they grounded hard and fast.
To clear up the situation and untangle the
mess, the tug boat signalled the “Wadena”
to let go her hawser. After a time the “Fitzpatrick”
was floated, towed off into the channel
in deeper water, anchored to await further
orders. Because the tug boat could be
of no assistance to the “Wadena” hard and
fast on the shoal, because of shoal water and
treacherous tides, she steamed away to Hyannis
to report to the owners and underwriters.
Because of that report, the next day,
the sixteenth, a Mr. Mack—William H. Mack,
the agent and part owner of those barges arrived
at Monomoy Station and requested Captain
Eldredge to put him aboard the “Wadena”,
Captain Eldredge and his crew
launched their lifeboat, took him aboard,
went down on the inside, on the bay side, out
around Point Rip, across the channel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
put him aboard his barge. They came back,
secured the lifeboat, went up to the station,
and established a watch, and the time wore
on. As time wore on Captain Eldredge
sensed there was bad weather coming. Remember
in those days, they had no radio to
give them advanced information about the
weather, they had to judge for themselves.
Captain Eldredge judged there was bad
weather coming and he was concerned because
he felt responsible for those men aboard
the barge without protection. So, in the afternoon,
he mustered his crew, launched the lifeboat
once more, went down on the inside
around Point Rip, across the channel, went
alongside the barge, climbed aboard, went
down into the cabin and talked with Mr.
Mack. He advised him about the weather and
urged him and the crew to come ashore and
stay at the station until better weather. But
Mr. Mack replied, “No, I refuse to desert my
barge. It is nice and warm down here in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
cabin, we have plenty to eat, and plenty to
drink. She is laying very quietly here on
the shoal and we will stay aboard.” After
a while, Captain Eldredge and his men went
back. They loaded the lifeboat on the gears,
shoved her into the boat-house, closed the
door, went up to the station, and re-established
their watch, waiting for night.</p>

<p>But in the late afternoon the watch reported
to Captain Eldredge that there was a
dory going out of Powder Hole, now Powder
Hole is a small boat harbor down on the inside
of Monomoy Beach. So the watch reported
that there was a dory going out of
Powder Hole with one occupant. Since it
was their duty to know what was going on
they watched this dory as it went out around
Point Rip. It headed off in the direction of
the “Fitzpatrick” anchored off in the channel.
It went way off alongside the barge. They
saw the man climb up over the rail and disappear
down in the cabin. Now the question
was “Who was the man?” It wasn’t any of
the crew of the “Fitzpatrick” who had been
ashore—that was impossible because they
didn’t understand the tide rips and the surf,
and besides they had no dory. Now, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
that man? Just before dark it was seen that
the men had hoisted the dory up to the davit,
indicating that he was going to stay all night.
The man of mystery! Why did the man of
mystery leave the Powder Hole? Why did
he leave a warm fire and row out in the face
of an incoming gale to spend the night aboard
the “Fitzpatrick”? The man of mystery!
But, don’t lose sight of the man of mystery.
He proved to be a hero in the tragedy which
is about to transpire.</p>

<p>That was the picture at sunset that night,
the “Wadena” hard and fast on Shovelful
Shoal with Mr. Mack and four men aboard.
The “Fitzpatrick” anchored off in the channel
with her crew and the man of mystery aboard.
Darkness settled down over Monomoy Beach
and, as predicted by Captain Eldredge the
storm came on. It was a southeast gale with
rain. The seas rolled in from that tremendous
expanse and pounded upon the shore.
The surfmen went their distance, down to
Point Rip, punched their time clocks, and
back.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the rules of the service was that at
daybreak the morning watch should go
up into the lookout and see if anything
had transpired during the night that hadn’t
been seen. The next morning, the morning of
the seventeenth, this was the fatal day, the
watch reported to Captain Eldredge that he
couldn’t see the “Wadena”. In fact he couldn’t
see the end of his beat. It was another one of
the rules that if you couldn’t see the end of
your beat because of thick weather, it was
your duty to dress up, sailors called it dressing
up when they put on their oil clothes and
boots, and go down until you could see. So
the watch was preparing to go when Captain
Eldredge changed his mind for some reason
or other and said to the watch, “Never mind.
You stay where you are. I’ll dress up and
go and see how it looks down at Point Rip.”
He put on his oil clothes, boots, and sou’wester.
He went down to the surf and headed south
for Point Rip four miles away. The lookout
watched him as he went and after a while
he slowly disappeared in the mist. Before
Captain Eldredge was promoted captain of
the old Monomoy Lifesaving Station he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
been a surfman for twelve years, for twelve
years he had patrolled the beach, night and
day, in all kinds of weather. But this morning
as he went down, this morning as he disappeared
in the mist, he was taking his last
walk. He was walking his last mile. In an
hour and three-quarters he arrived at the little
shanty but he couldn’t see. So he went
way down to the end of the beach, climbed
up on a sand dune, and looked off. At first
he couldn’t see, but after a while, there came
a rift in the mist. Then he saw. There was
the “Wadena” still hard and fast on the shoal,
the rift widened and then he saw, there in her
rigging was the American Flag, union down,
a signal of mutiny or distress. In every great
tragedy, in every great disaster, there are
men sitting at home beside the fire who offer
criticism. Men criticized Captain Eldredge
because he went out at that particular time
when the tide was running to the windward
kicking up a nasty treacherous sea, but we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
must remember that there wasn’t a cowardly
cell in the make-up of Captain Eldredge. If
anything, he was too courageous. There was
the American Flag, union down. To him, it
was “go” rather than be branded a coward
forever or impeached for insubordination.
The American flag union down, he had no
alternative, it was go even though he knew
he was going down into the valley of the
shadow of death, he hesitated not a minute.
He hastened over to the shanty, called the station,
got the number one man on the wire
who happened to be Seth Linwood Ellis of
Harwichport. He said, “Ellis, the “Wadena”
has her colors in the rigging. We are going
off. Launch the small boat, come down on
the inside. I will walk over across and you
can pick me up.” Men have criticized Captain
Eldredge because he ordered the small
boat. At that time the old Monomoy Station
had but two lifeboats. One, called the small
boat which was kept down in the boat house
on the inside just above the high water-mark.
The other was called the large boat built right
up to date at that time. They kept her in
the boat house connected with the station,
something like a half-mile from the water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Captain Eldredge knew that it would be a
tremendous task to launch the big boat, haul
her down over the sand dunes down in the
hollows and through the sand, especially
when they were short-handed. So, influenced
by the American Flag union down, to save
time he ordered the small boat. Seth Linwood
Ellis, obeying the orders of his superior,
launched the small boat. They went down
on the inside and as they went down, they
saw Captain Eldredge standing way out on
the beach. They went in as close as they
could and Captain Eldredge waded out,
climbed aboard, and took the steering oar.
Seth Linwood Ellis took the after thwart,
shipped his oar, and they were ready to proceed.
But before they proceed let’s look at
the boat. This was a lapstreak boat. Suppose
you live in a clap-boarded house, turn
it upside down, throw in about ten or fifteen
feet of water, and jump in and try to save
yourself, by clinging to those clapboards with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
a half inch margin, three inch space, and half
inch margin. When that boat was bottom
up, the only thing they had to cling to was
those half-inch margins.</p>

<p>Who was in the boat at the time? We
may as well know because their names are
engraved on the granite monument down by
Chatham Light. That monument is going to
be there a long time and when we read those
names we want to know what it was all about.
There was Arthur W. Rogers of North Harwich.
A typical Cape Codder, he stood six
feet tall, weighed 185, was married, and had
one child. There was Valentine D. Nickerson.
He was a twin, he had a twin brother
by the name of Charlie. He stood six feet
tall, weighed 185, and was hard and wiry.
He lived at the junction of Main Street and
Great Western Road in the depot section in
a house now occupied by the family of Joseph
Munroe. He had a wife and four girls.
Osborne F. Chase. He was a short thick-set
man. He had been a surfman a long time,
he was very capable and dependable. He
lived at the corner of South and Main Streets
in the depot section a short distance from
Valentine D. Nickerson. He had a wife and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
three girls. Next Elijah Kendrick, the youngest
of them all, was born and brought up on
Gorham Road in South Harwich in a house
now owned by Edward N. Johnson. At the
time of the disaster he lived in Harwich Center
opposite the ball-park. The house has
been moved away. He was married and had
a boy and girl. Then there was Edgar C.
Small of Harwich Center. The counterpart
of Valentine Nickerson, hard and wiry, he was
born and brought up on the Harwich-Chatham
Road in a house now owned by a man by the
name of Harry Young. He had a wife, son
and daughter. Seth Linwood Ellis who lived
on Freeman Street in Harwichport, stood six
feet, weighed 190, and had a wife and son.
In his younger days he was noted for his dogged
determination, physical stamina and perserverance.
He was the only surfman who
went down to Point Rip the night of the Portland
Blizzard and returned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>The first watch down that night from
eight to twelve was Osborne F. Chase.
At eight o’clock he stepped out into that
raging, smothering storm and disappeared.
At twelve o’clock he hadn’t returned.</p>

<p>The watch from twelve to four was Seth
Linwood Ellis. Captain Tuttle called him out.
He put on his oil clothes, boots and sou’wester,
strapped his time clock on his back and
stepped out into the storm. That night part
of the beach was flooded, so he walked up in
the center of the beach. He went down in the
darkness and the storm guided by the tremendous
roar of the surf, and in the utter darkness
he missed the little shanty. He heard the
surf roaring all around him so he knew he
was down on the end of the beach. He went
back a little way, found the shanty, punched
his time clock, and started back. The wind
was blowing from sixty to eighty miles an
hour with a smothering, blinding snow storm
and it was so dark that it was impossible to
see a thing. After a while he ran into something,
looking up he saw the glimmer of
a light, it was the old Monomoy Lighthouse.
He ran into the broad-side of the old Monomoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Lighthouse and didn’t see it. He edged
out by it and started up in the teeth of the
wind, following the roar of the surf. Unless
you have been there you cannot imagine the
tremendous sickening roar of the surf combined
with the shrieking of the wind in a
storm like the “Portland Blizzard.” When
the roar became deafening, Ellis would edge
inland. When the roar deadened, he would
edge back. So he worked his way up the
beach. Many years before surfmen complained
that in stormy thick weather they had
trouble finding the station and sometimes
went by it. So they took some weir poles,
dug them down in the sand about ten or
twelve feet apart extending from the station
down to the high water mark. This made a
land mark, but even then men sometimes
would go between the poles and not see them.
Coming up the beach that night, Ellis ran
into one of these poles, followed them up to
the station, and went in. Captain Tuttle took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
off the face of his time clock and looked at
it. It proved that he had been down to Point
Rip, punched his time, and returned one hour
late. That was Seth Linwood Ellis. Osborne
Chase never returned until well after daylight.
He got lost—lost all sense of direction
and wandered around the beach all night
with out finding the little shanty that had the
key to his time clock nailed to the wall.
In the summer of 1887 Seth Linwood
Ellis sailed out of Gloucester with Captain
Hanson Joyce, mackerel seining. For the
first time Captain Joyce went in a steamer
instead of a sailing vessel as was the custom
in those days. He carried two seine boats
and two crews. He appointed Ellis captain
of one boat, and he himself took the other.
One morning about five miles off Highland
Light they sighted a school of fish. Captain
Joyce sent Ellis out after them in his boat.
He saw the fish, jockeyed into position, and
gave the order to go ahead and start throwing.
In those days whenever a seineboat went
out for a school of fish it was always trailed
by a dory. When they started throwing the
seine the dory would pick up the end and wait
until the boat came around, then pass the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
to the boat, making a complete circle. The
captain stood in the extreme end of the boat
on a raised platform, steering with an oar.
Captain Ellis was a powerful man. Circling
the school of fish that morning he gave an
extra hard pull on the oar and it broke. He
fell over backward, splash, into the sea. The
men in the boat stopped rowing, intending to
back and pick him up. He came to the surface,
shook the water out of his face, and
shouted “Don’t stop, go on around the fish,
never mind me.” The men obeyed, the seine
boat circled the fish the dory passed the end
to the boat, then went back about half a mile
and picked him up. Even today we don’t
understand how he kept afloat with a pair of
rubber boots and oil petticoat on. But that
was Seth Linwood Ellis. Don’t lose sight of
Seth Linwood Ellis in the struggle that is
about to follow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>Then there was Isaac T. Foy of South
Chatham. He was of average height
and was that handsome that the women
called him the “Handsome Surfman.” He was
married, but had no children. Before Isaac T.
Foy, I was a surf man on the old Monomoy
Lifesaving Station. One disagreeable stormy
day off on the shoals assisting a stranded
schooner, I was severely injured almost fatally.
For over two years I fought against that thing
called death, and at last I won. It was one of
the rules of the service that whenever you were
disabled, you were kept on the roll for a year.
At the end of the year, if you didn’t come forward
with the required physical percentage,
you were dropped from the service. So I was
dropped from the service. Of all the men
who applied for the position they selected
Isaac T. Foy. Without a doubt—without
a doubt if it had not been for that injury I
had received, I would have been with those
men in the boat that morning, and Isaac T.
Foy would have been elsewhere. Do you believe
in luck? Do you believe in fate? Do
you believe in an unseen power that controls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the destiny of every human being like you and
I? We have the right to believe as we will
but over forty-one years have passed along
since that fatal day and here I stand telling
you the story. But where, oh where is Isaac
Thomas Foy. Pay attention to this tragedy
as it develops and see the end—the tragic
end of the man who took my place and carried
on.</p>

<p>Then there was Captain Marshall N.
Eldredge of South Chatham. A giant in stature,
standing over six feet tall, weighing
two hundred and twenty pounds, hard as
nails, he was the toughest surfman who ever
patrolled Monomoy Beach. He was so tough
that he went barefooted in the cold sand until
the first of December. In the early spring
and fall, he wouldn’t wear oil clothes but
said that he would rather be wet than bother
with them at all. He had a wife and three
children. Those were the men in the boat
that morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>They were all ready. Captain Eldredge
gave the orders to go ahead. It was the 1st
of a southeast storm the tide was running to
the windward kicking up a nasty treacherous
sea. They went around the point and headed
into the rips. Some of the rips they went
around; the smaller ones they went through.
So they worked themselves along slowly but
surely. At last they arrived at the barge
safely. They threw the painter aboard, and
it was made fast. Captain Eldredge saw Mr.
Mack standing on deck. He hailed them and
said, “Mr. Mack, you’ve got your colors in
the rigging. What’s the trouble?” Mr. Mack
said, “We had an awful night last night. The
wind blew and those seas rolled in, and we
pounded and thumped on the bottom until
we thought we were going to pieces. We were
afraid and still are and we want to go ashore.”
Captain Eldredge replied, “That’s all right,
but we’re not coming aboard. It’s too rough.
Throw a rope over the side and lower yourselves
down.” So they came down, one by
one, and the captain placed them in the bottom
of the boat in a safe place. He put three
of them on the platform at his feet, the other
he put on the thwarts outside the oarsmen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
They pumped out the boat and everything
was ready. Captain Eldredge gave the order,
“Cast Off.” There was no-one aboard to cast
off so Osborne F. Chase, the bowman, cut
the painter and as he did her bow fell off, a
sea came rolling around the lee quarter,
caught the boat under her bilge, and shoved
her ahead. As she went out from under the
lee of the “Wadena” the tide caught her under
the weather bow and she drifted off in the
trough of the sea. Before the men could get
control of their oars, a sea broke over in the
bottom of the boat. Those men from the
barge, the very men they were trying to
save, if they had only known—why one of
the first lessons you are taught when you go
out over the surf in an open boat in a rough
sea is to sit down, the lower the better, and
no matter what happens, if a sea breaks over
and wets your feet, take your medicine but
sit still. But when that sea broke over and
wet their feet they all jumped up, interfered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
with the oarsmen, and then they couldn’t row.
The boat drifted off into a rip, another sea
broke over, and filled her half full. Then
all was confusion. She drifted into another
rip, another sea broke over her, another, and
still another. Down she went, turned over,
and came up floating bottom up. Every man
struggling in the sea. Captain Mack and his
men never had a chance. In five minutes
they all were engulfed by the seas, except
one. One young boy, a colored fellow, was
clinging to the bow of the boat. He was so
afraid that he turned yellow, and the whites
of his eyes bulged right out of his head. A
sea came rushing along, broke over him, and
washed him off. He gave a terrible scream,
threw up both hands, and went down to join his
companions who had gone a few minutes before.
Now the surfmen—every man for
himself, no orders, no discipline, every man
struggling and fighting for a position on the
bottom of that up-turned boat. At first they
all got a hold. Osborne F. Chase was clinging
on the bow where the young colored fellow
had just been washed off. A sea came
breaking and tearing along, it caught him
in its grasp, he lost his hold and drifted away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the first to go. Captain Eldredge, weighing
two hundred and twenty pounds, weighted
down with his oil clothes and boots, was
fighting amidships. He was grabbing and
clutching at those lapstreaks. A sea broke
over, caught him in the face and chest, and
washed him off. He grabbed again but he
was short and went drifting off in those rushing,
roaring rips. The next, Elijah Kendricks,
if anyone had told me that the crew
of the Monomoy Station would be lost with
the exception of one and asked me who the
one would be I would have said without any
hesitation, “Elijah Kendricks”. He was an
athlete from the word go he excelled in all
sports, in running, jumping, baseball, skating
and swimming. He was a regular water-dog
in his day, but was rendered helpless
by the carelessness of another. When that
boat left the shore that morning, laying on
her thwarts was a sail. It was a mutton leg
sail used in times of emergency. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
wind was fair the men would sail instead of
row. It was a rule that the sail should be
lashed to the thwart. Someone neglected
his duty because that sail came floating out
from under the boat, right up under Kendricks.
He struggled and kicked to free himself
but his feet became tangled up in the
halyards and main sheets. With this added
weight, he couldn’t hold on. He grabbed
and clutched at those lapstreaks but his fingers
slipped. He sensed his doom, threw
himself over on the mast and boom, floated
away and was never seen again. Now five
men left, five men still fighting and struggling
for their lives, five men still clutching and
clawing at those lapstreaks. She drifted into
another rip this was the largest of them
all. It was on the shoalest part of Shovelful
Shoal. That morning on Shovelful Shoal the
seas were breaking and pounding, hissing and
foaming, roaring and crossing, a combination
of sand and water, five men still clinging
on, Arthur W. Rogers, Valentine D. Nickerson,
Edgar C. Small, Seth Linwood Ellis and
Isaac T. Foy—five men fighting for their
lives—she drifted into this rip and was completely
submerged. What happened nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
knows. It was a fearful tragedy, an unseen
drama. When she drifted out on the other
side in a smoother sea there were only two
left. Isaac T. Foy wasn’t there. Isaac T.
Foy perished in those breaking, pounding
seas on the shoalest part of Shovelful Shoal.
When she drifted out on the other side in a
smoother sea there was only two left. Arthur
W. Rogers was clinging to the bow of that
boat waterlogged and exhausted. He was
that exhausted he could hardly raise his arms.
Seth Linwood was lying across the bottom
clinging on with the grip of death. She
drifted into another rip a sea came swashing
along and washed Arthur W. Rogers amidships
he grabbed and clutched at those lapstreaks
but couldn’t hold. A sea washed
him still further, he sensed his doom, with a
supreme effort he threw himself upon the bottom
of that boat and grabbed again, his fingers
slipped a sea washed him off. He sank,
a few bubbles and he was gone forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Now Seth Linwood Ellis alone on the
bottom of that boat fighting for his life. His
dogged determination, physical stamina, and
perserverance had just begun to assert themselves.
All the others had perished, but he
had commenced to fight. He kicked off his
rubber boots, he tore off his oil clothes, his
jacket vest and trousers, intending as a last
resort to swim for the shore. Then he was
washed up on the crest of a sea and looking
over saw the “Fitzpatrick” and going down
over her side was a dory; sitting on the
thwart of that dory was a man, then Ellis
remembered;—the man of mystery.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>Aboard the “Fitzpatrick” that morning
the Captain and the man of mystery
were down in the cabin, talking and
smoking. The man of mystery seemed to be
nervous and fidgety, something unusual for
him. He would walk the floor, then sit down,
then he would walk again. At last he went up
on deck and looked around, as he did he saw
an object floating in the rips. He took the
spyglasses and looked to make sure. Then
he said to the captain who was standing near,
“In those rips is a boat bottom up and clinging
to the bottom is a man. Launch my
dory.” The captain said, “No. Your dory
wouldn’t live in those rushing rips.” He was
a sailor, not a surfman and didn’t understand
the possibilities of a thirteen foot dory when
handled by an expert. He looked around.
The man of mystery had gone. He ran across
the deck to his dory jumped up on the rail
and said to some of the crew standing around,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
“Lower away.” They “lowered away” until
the dory hit the water. He unhooked the
tackles, shipped his oars and started out in
the direction of the object. Going in the
direction of the object took him almost in the
trough of the sea. As he went under the lee
of the “Fitzpatrick” he took the whole force
of those seas. He looked up and there was
a sea forming and hissing, ready to break.
He turned, took in the bow, and went over
safely. Off again in the direction of the object,
another sea rising and breaking, he
turned, took it on the bow, and goes over
safely. And so on and on closer and closer,
slowly but surely. In the meantime, Ellis,
on the bottom of the boat, was taking awful
punishment. The seas were breaking and
pounding down upon him with tremendous
force. They would wash him off this side,
he would crawl back, they would wash him
off the other side, he would crawl right back.
With dogged determination, physical stamina
and perserverance, he clung to the bottom of
that boat like a spider to a wall. He went
up on the crest of another sea and looked
for the dory. This time the man of mystery
had worked the dory way up to the windward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
He didn’t intend to lose that man on
the bottom of the boat. This time he came
running down on the crest of a sea. When
you are running on a crest of a sea like that
it is suicide to try to stop or try to turn this
way or that. Let the sea have her, but keep
her steady. For remember that every sea
at last spends itself. So this time he came
running down on the crest of a sea and went
right by within four or five feet. It was an
anxious minute for Ellis. But, as he went
by, Ellis recognized him, it was Elmer Mayo
of Chatham, an expert surfman, one of the
very best. The sea at last spent itself and
in the lull that followed, Mayo backed right
back up to the boat. Ellis grabbed hold of
the gunwale, hauled himself over, slid to
the bottom of the dory, and they started for
shore. Another fight, another struggle with
the seas, seas that were running and breaking
mountain high, seas that lifted them like
a cork to their foamy crest. Seas, running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
seas that took them in their grasp and carried
them ahead like frightened deer until they
fell back into the trough of another. Ahead
of them the surf was still pounding, and
breaking and roaring upon the shore. At last
they arrived at the surf. Mayo looked along
for an opening, but those seas were still running
in from an expanse of three thousand
miles, still breaking and roaring upon the
strand in an unbroken line. What a position,
what a spot—two human beings being in an
open dory in those rushing, raging seas. They
jockeyed for position waiting for the right sea—the
third sea. When seas are running like
that, there are always two large ones and then
a smaller one. The third sea is always smaller
than the two which precede it. God made
it so and surfmen since time immemorial have
taken advantage of the third sea. So Mayo
was jockeying for position waiting for the
third sea. At last it came hissing, foaming
and roaring. They were in proper position.
With a roar, it broke directly under their
stem and taking them in its grasp carried
them ahead up, up onto the beach. Mayo
jumped out and held the dory. The sea
receded. Seth Linwood Ellis stepped out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
onto the cold sand, barefooted. Nothing on
but his underclothes. There he stood, Seth
Linwood Ellis the lone survivor of the Monomoy
Disaster. He told me many times that
he grew to manhood an absolute teetotaler,
never using tobacco in any form. With those
temperate habits and an outdoor life, he built
up a physical constitution which produced
for him a physical superiority that won for
him that day the battle with the seas, when
all others perished. He then and there became
noted the country over as the lone survivor
of the Monomoy Disaster. In time he
was promoted captain of the old Monomoy
Lifesaving Station, and sometime later the
United States Congress recognized his victory
over the sea and presented him with a Congressional
Medal.</p>

<p>So it is—those men who were lost and
the one who was saved are simply samples
of the men who, in former days, were the
backbones and stability of Cape Cod—Cape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Cod which has always played an honorable
part in the history of the state of Massachusetts.
When Massachusetts derived her sustenance
from the ocean, Cape Cod produced
her quota of the men who went down to the
sea in ships. At one time she was the very
womb: the very cradle of fishermen and sailors,
the best the world produced. She gave
to the sea her best blood, the energy of her
youth, and the counsel of her old. The salt
waves of the sea have been the shroud, and
the surges of the sea the funeral knell of
many of her brave men. But now all is
changed. In the bays, the harbors, and the
inlets where once the ships, the brigs, the
barks, the schooners, and the sloops swung
proudly at anchor, the waves now ripple in
silence and sadness.</p>

<p>Thus ends the chapter of the “Tragedy
of Monomoy Beach, or the Graveyard of the
Atlantic.”</p>

<p>FINIS</p>

<p>The story of The Monomoy Disaster
must impress all readers with the sturdy
character of the men who went down to the
sea in ships in former days, when Cape Cod
was a haven of sea Captains and rugged men
of the sea.</p>

<p>As we dedicate this book to these men of
steel we present as a closing tribute, the defenders
of American freedom and liberty of
the present day. The following men and
women of Chatham and Harwich are now serving
the colors in the various branches of the
armed forces and the Honor Roll is complete
as of August 1, 1943. We salute each and
every one and may God grant them a safe return.</p>
